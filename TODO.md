- when someone added as a friend, they don't show up on the friends tab immedately, needs app refresh
- sending and accepting friend requests takes way too long than it should, find out why is that so
- the "1 notification" badge in "Leaderboard" and zeego leaderboard dropdown do not refresh after you have accepted the friend request.
- add an edit profile feature
- create a landing page for the app (and alongside it, create the assets required to upload it on the appstore as well, use the heck out of canva for that)
